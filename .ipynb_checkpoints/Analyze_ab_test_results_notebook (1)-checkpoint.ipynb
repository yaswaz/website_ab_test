    "The principal adventage of adding other factors to a regression model is that it gives us more of the information available to us to estimate the dependent variable. In reality a variable is usually affected by many othe variables. For example it was mentioned earlier that because of the time stamp associated with each event, you could technically run a hypothesis test continuously as each observation was observed. Looking at the time stamps for each visit and when conversion occurs we can look at for possible correlation.\n",
    "Looking at only a section of the data without considering the other parts can also lead to skewed or unfair conclusions. This is explained by the Simpson's paradox, which is a phenomenon in probability and statistics, in which a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox). For example: When we are able study a variety of variables in the data we can uncover the role timing and country play in the conversion of either page. More people might convert at different times of the day for one page over another.\n",
    "Simpson’s paradox is important for three critical reasons. First, people often expect statistical relationships to be immutable. They often are not. The relationship between two variables might increase, decrease, or even change direction depending on the set of variables being controlled. Second, Simpson’s paradox is not simply an obscure phenomenon of interest only to a small group of statisticians. Simpson’s paradox is actually one of a large class of association paradoxes. Third, Simpson’s paradox reminds researchers that causal inferences, particularly in nonexperimental studies, can be hazardous. Uncontrolled and even unobserved variables that would eliminate or reverse the association observed between two variables might exist (https://www.britannica.com/topic/Simpsons-paradox)\n",
    "\n",
    "Likely Disadvantages of adding variables:\n",
    "1. Adding variables might bring up Multicollinearity which occurs when there are high correlations among predictor variables, leading to unreliable and unstable estimates of regression coefficients(https://statisticalhorizons.com/multicollinearity).\n",
    "2. Another likely disadvantage of adding variables is Covariance. Covariance is a measure of how changes in one variable are associated with changes in a second variable. Specifically, covariance measures the degree to which two variables are linearly associated(https://medium.com/@thecodingcookie/covariance-correlation-def860c4d4ab). Covariance can make interpreting results difficult and even make R values unreliable.</div>\n",
